The sky breaks open and the rain falls down 
Oh, and the pain is blinding 
But we carry on... 
Seems like the end of everything 
When the one you love 
Turns their back on you 
And the whole world falls down on you... 
It's the end of the world 
It's the end of the world 
Well, I'm holding on...
But the world keeps dragging me down... 
It's the end of the world 
It's the end of the world 
Well, I'm holding on... 
But the world keeps dragging me down... 
I got my heart on lockdown 
And my eyes on the lookout 
But I just know that I'm 
Never gonna win this 
They can keep the lights on 
They can keep the music loud 
I don't need anything 
When I got my music 
And I'm holding on... 
The sky breaks open and the rain falls down 
And the pain is blinding 
But we carry on 
(They tell you lies) 
I'm holding on... 
(They tell you lies)The sky breaks open and the rain falls down
